        <div id="intro">
            <h2>The Big Problem</h2>
            <p>
                The Media Arts and Design program at JMU is known for its hands-on learning. Many students need access
                to
                recording equipment for their classes. SMAD provides a website to reserve equipment from the checkout
                room,
                perfect for completing required assignments. But is this too good to be true?
            </p>

            <p>
                I am one of these students who has had to reserve cameras, lights, and mics, from this website. And it's
                not
                simple. Many of my classmates have also expressed concerns over using the site. From its confusing
                layout,
                hidden features, vague wording, and unuseful homepage, there's lots to be changed here. I decided to
                focus
                just on the issue of adding equipment to a reservation, because it's a highly necessary functionality
                for
                students.
            </p>

            <p>
                For this process, I started by analyzing SMAD BookedScheduler and making an hypothesis about
                the
                main issues based on my experiences. Then I formulated a survey polling respondents on their
                history
                using the app, which guided my final design question. Then I began structuring my solution to that
                question
                by considering information architecture, layout schemes, user goals, and design sophistication.
                Finally, I created mockups for my proposed solution to encapsulate all the research done on the issue.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="user-goals">
            <h2>User Goals</h2>
            <p>
                The primary users of SMAD BookedScheduler are students trying to reserve video equipment to use on
                projects.
                While most students I have seen use the site on computers, it is common to use it on a mobile site too.
                I
                will be focusing on the desktop version for this redesign.
            </p>

            <p>The primary goals of SMAD BookedScheduler are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a reservation</li>
                <li>Add equipment to a reservation</li>
                <li>See when equipment is available</li>
                <li>View your reservations</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div id="app-analysis">
            <h2>App Analysis</h2>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/curr-homepage.png" alt="Current Homepage">
                <figcaption>Current Homepage for SMAD BookedScheduler</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Starting at the homepage, most of the content is irrelevant and unused by the checkout room.
                Announcements are never posted and upcoming reservations aren't a high priority feature.
                Unless
                you have a reservation already set, nothing appears here, so it's just a blank box. If we follow the
                principles of visual hierarchy and information architecture, the first items on the homepage
                aren't even useful when comparing them to the goals of the app.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Resource Availability section is only half useful. It adds items based on what you've ordered in the
                past
                and allows you to add favorite items that will appear at the top. They're on the right track with this
                but
                reading the availability of the item is difficult. Also, you can't reserve multiple items from the list
                at
                once without going into the default reservation screen. Therefore, even though this section of the
                homepage
                meets the creating a reservation requirement, it fails on several others.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/reserve-tab.png" alt="Reservations Tab">
                <figcaption>Current Reservations Tab</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Next I looked at the reservations tab on the nav bar. Here I found a lot of options that were very
                similar.
                The most important tab is "Schedule" which conveniently is located at the top. All the other tabs,
                however,
                took me to confusing pages with lots of input fields or calendars that didn't relate much to the
                goals.
                It seems like the site has a bunch of unnecessary features, yet hides the main scheduler which is
                the
                most common function.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/schedule-screen.png" alt="Scheduling Calendar">
                <figcaption>Current Scheduling Calendar</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                If you are able to find the scheduling calendar, you can see all the equipment and when it's available.
                At
                first glance, my eye was drawn to the color coding key. I know from experience that many of these colors
                aren't used by the checkout room workers so it seems like clutter. You can see the date in the top right
                corner and there's helpful arrow keys to move around. All the equipment is on the left of the calendar
                with
                dates on the top. It's easy to see when items are available, unlike trying to reserve them on the
                homepage.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/reserve-screen.png" alt="Reservation Screen">
                <figcaption>Current Reservation Screen</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                When you click on an open time slot you're taken to the main reservation screen--same as if you clicked
                reserve on the home page. The input fields are easy to see and understand, though the need for a
                description is questionable given most users are students using it for class. If you wanted to add more
                equipment to the reservation, there's a plus sign but it's next to "Change" which should be named to
                represent the addition of items. "Change" makes it seem like the user is editing the one item they
                selected, not adding more. The submit or "create" button is in the top right corner, which I believe to
                be against common UX form submissions where it's located at the bottom.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div id="research">
            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <h3>Survey</h3>
            <p>
                To ensure my predictions are realistic I sent a Google Survey to my peers in various SMAD group chats. I
                knew this demographic of people had a mix of SMAD concentrators that may or may not have used the site
                before. I asked a variety of questions aimed at determining if they had experienced issues with SMAD
                BookedScheduler.
            </p>

            <p>
                From my survey 80% of the 10 respondents said they had used the website to rent equipment. Not
                surprising was
                <em>87%</em> of those users had experienced difficulty with making a reservation.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/web-difficulties.png" alt="graph of why respondents had issues with the site">
            </figure>

            <p>
                This chart shows a breakdown of various reasons why the respondents had issues using the site. Most
                commonly, they couldn't find where to make the reservation or where to add multiple items. One of the
                respondents said "Trying to figure out what is available for reservation is frustrating" and another
                said "It’s just not very user friendly".
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/many-equip.png"
                    alt="graph of how many struggled with adding multiple pieces of equipment">
            </figure>

            <p>
                I wanted to know how difficult adding many things to their reservation was. Again, the
                results were consistent with my assumptions. 75% of respondents agreed that they struggled with how to
                do this. One even admitted "I used to go in and reserve each piece of equipment separately until someone
                showed me that I could put them all under one reservation".
            </p>

            <h3>Usability Interview</h3>

            <p>
                I also interviewed a few peers in the Computer Science department. With no prior experience on the app,
                I wanted to watch them make a reservation for a camera and add a shotgun mic. Both of them saw the list
                of things on the homepage and used the list selector to find the camera. Parth was confused when he
                selected it because it added to the list of resources, but didn't start a reservation. Both of them then
                clicked the "Reserve" button which took them to the reservation screen. Carter didn't know what to put
                for the title field but found the plus icon fine. Both struggled with what to put in the description
                field.
            </p>

            <p>
                They were able to make a reservation, but they didn't check to see if something was even available. I
                asked them if they would have went to the reservation tab to find the schedule button and calendar view.
                Carter said "I saw reserve on the homepage next to equipment and assumed that was where to go". Parth
                admitted "I didn’t know about the calendar as a first time user, I just used the search bar on the home
                page".
            </p>

            <p>
                From this experiment, it is clear the homepage doesn't provide good guides to indicate the very useful
                scheduling calendar even exists. I also found it interesting they didn't seem to care if something was
                available or not. This could lead to serious issues as classes pick up throughout the semester.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="prob">
            <h2>Defining The Problem</h2>
            <p>
                SMAD BookedScheduler is trying to accomplish too much for its user base. Students are looking to
                quickly make multi-equipment reservations and are met with confusion over where to do this. Hardly
                anyone uses the advanced features under the reservations tab and the homepage includes irrelevant
                information.
            </p>

            <p>From my analysis and user research, the pain points I identified are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A non-useful homepage that doesn't display relevant information.</li>
                <li>Unclear indication on where to make a reservation.</li>
                <li>Poor emphasis on where to add equipment to a reservation.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Leading to the main design question:
            </p>

            <p id="design-q">How can we improve the experience of students making multi-piece reservations in SMAD
                BookedScheduler?</p>
        </div>

        <div id="redesign">
            <h2>The Redesign</h2>
            <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
            <p>
                So that I could visualize the way SMAD BookedScheduler is set up currently, I created a diagram showing
                the functionalities and where they're grouped on the site.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/ia-graph.png" alt="Information Architecture of tabs and their contents">
            </figure>

            <p>
                Since I'm focused on editing the reservation user flow, I mainly changed the homepage and
                reservations tab. I decided to remove the "Announcements" and "Upcoming Reservations" tab and add a
                section
                for making a reservation. I changed the "Reservations" tab to remove unnecessary features and clarify
                where to make a reservation.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/new-ia-graph.png" alt="Revised Information Architecture of tabs and their contents">
            </figure>

            <p>
                Here, the two "Make a Reservation" areas will link to the same schedule calendar. That way, the
                interface will be the same for all users trying to reserve something. I think the schedule calendar is
                the easiest and most convenient way to see what equipment exists, when it's free, and how to reserve it.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's now easier for the user to identify the functionality of each tab in "Reservations". Users have one
                place to go and look up information for current and past reservations. For example, "Printing a
                Reservation" is something very few people do, so instead of putting it in the main submenu, it now
                belongs inside the "My Reservations" tab.
            </p>

            <h3>Main User Flow</h3>

            <p>
                I formulated two different flows users can take to reserve equipment: clicking "Make a Reservation" from
                the home screen or clicking the tab for it under "Reservations". The diagram will be the same from this
                point forward since we are now using the same scheduling calendar.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/user-flow.png" alt="User flow for updated interface">
            </figure>

            <p>
                A few things to note about the diagram:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Users can now click and drag to select a time from the calendar instead of just clicking the
                    starting time</li>
                <li>The reservation form will have a place to add frequently used items</li>
                <li>Users can now select multiple items from the equipment list at once where before you could only
                    select one</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mockups</h3>

            <p>
                Taking all the research into consideration, I created new designs for the homepage, reservations tab,
                and reservation screen.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/new-homepage.jpg" alt="Redesigned Homepage">
                <figcaption>Redesigned Homepage</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                This new design removes features like "Announcements" and "Reservation Schedule" that were unused and
                poorly placed in the visual architecture. It simplifies what the user is looking at and draws emphasis
                to the
                main user goal: making a reservation. I kept the resource availability tab because it still could be
                useful, but also because my main user flow is being accomplished through other revisions.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/new-reserve-tab.png" alt="Redesigned Reservation Tab">
                <figcaption>Redesigned Reservation Screen</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                The new reservations tab removes the plethora of extra features to leave only the most important
                features. I also revised the wording to better mimic what a user would expect. For example, I changed
                "Schedule" to "Make a Reservation" since that is more clear. All the extra functions related to past
                reservations would now be found under the "My Reservations" tab. This, again, reduces clutter and
                makes the tab contents easier to read.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now a new user has two clear points of contact to make a
                reservation which should help reduce the confusion found from the user research.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="/images/new-reserve-screen.jpg" alt="Redesigned Reservation Screen">
                <figcaption>Redesigned Reservation Screen</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                I kept the schedule calendar the same and moved onto the reservation screen. My two main goals were
                limiting unnecessary fields and clarifying where to reserve multiple items. From my user research I
                found many didn't use the description field and found the title field to be
                extra work. The only input field that exists now is the "Class and Project" field, arguably the most
                important information needed for the equipment room. I reduced the clutter surrounding the time section
                to just keep the most important requirements: a start and end time.
            </p>

            <p>
                To tackle the equipment pain point I added an "Add Equipment" button that would take the user to an
                overall list to see what equipment is available. Anything free to reserve during the specified time
                would be at the top of the list. Any items not free would be greyed out at the bottom. I also included a
                easy way to add equipment that's
                frequently reserved. This would take prior reservations and remember which items are used most. To
                handle scheduling conflicts, the new BookedScheduler would only remember the general item, like Shotgun
                Kit, and find whichever specific item, like Shotgun Kit A, is free at the same time. If it cannot find
                an item for the same time, it won't add it to the list on the left and will present a popup explaining
                that
                item isn't available at the given time.

                I also relocated the submit button to the bottom of the form, complying with most UX standards. I
                changed the text from "Submit" to "Make Reservation" to relate it back to the desired action from
                the user of making the reservation. While a subtle change, I think it reinforces the clarity and
                consistency across the platform.

                These changes will make SMAD BookedScheduler's usability far superior to its current version. The site
                is essential for SMAD students working on
                projects, therefore, the demand for a usable and simple site is high. The designs proposed in this
                redesign satisfy many pain points identified and improve student experience.
